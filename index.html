<p><h2>Arrested Development</h2></p>
<p>courtesy of Wikipedia</p>
<br><br>
<p>Arrested Development is an American television sitcom created by Mitchell Hurwitz. 
The series aired for three seasons on the Fox network from 2003 to 2006, with new episodes 
planned for release on Netflix in 2013. The show centers on the Bluth family, a formerly
 wealthy and habitually dysfunctional family, and is presented in a continuous format, 
 incorporating hand-held camera work, narration, archival photos, and historical footage. 
 Ron Howard serves as an executive producer and the series' uncredited narrator. 
 Set in Newport Beach, California, Arrested Development is primarily filmed in Culver City
 and Marina del Rey. <br/><br/>
 
 Since its debut in 2003, the series has received widespread critical acclaim,
 including six Emmy Awards and one Golden Globe, and it has attracted a cult following, 
 including several fan-based websites. In 2007 Time listed it among the magazine's 
 "100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME." In 2008, the show was ranked 16th on Entertainment 
 Weekly's "New TV Classics" list. In 2011, IGN named Arrested Development the funniest 
 show of all time.<br/><br/>
 
 
 Despite approval from critics, Arrested Development received low ratings and 
 viewership on Fox, which canceled the series in 2006. Rumors of a fourth season and a 
 feature film persisted until 2011, when Netflix agreed to license new episodes and 
 distribute them exclusively on its streaming video service. Fourteen episodes will be 
 released on the same day in May 2013. The script of an Arrested Development film has 
 also been in development with the main cast purported to reprise their original roles.</p>
 <br><br>
 
 <p><h3>Conception<hr/></h3></p>
 
 
 <p>Discussion that led to the creation of the series began in the summer of 2002.
  Ron Howard had the original idea to create a comedy series in the style of handheld 
  cameras and reality television, but with an elaborate, highly comical script resulting 
  from repeated rewritings and rehearsals. Howard met with David Nevins, the President of 
  Imagine Television, Katie O'Connell, a senior vice president, and two writers, 
  including Mitchell Hurwitz. In light of recent corporate accounting scandals, such as 
  Enron and Adelphia, Hurwitz suggested a story about a "riches to rags" family. Howard 
  and Imagine were immediately interested in using this idea, and signed Hurwitz to 
  write the show. The idea was pitched and sold in the fall of 2002. Over the next few 
  months, Hurwitz developed the characters and plot for the series. The script of the 
  pilot episode was submitted in January 2003 and filmed in March 2003. It was submitted 
  in late April to Fox and was added to the network's fall schedule that May. </p>
  <br><br>
  
  <p><h3>Casting<hr/></h3></p>
  
  <p>Alia Shawkat was the first actress to be cast in the series. Michael Cera, Tony Hale, 
  and Jessica Walter were cast from video tapes and flown in to audition for Fox. 
  Jason Bateman and Portia de Rossi both read and auditioned for the network and were 
  immediately chosen. The character of Gob was apparently the most challenging to cast.
   When Will Arnett auditioned, he depicted the character "like a guy who thought of himself
    as the chosen son even though it was obvious to everyone else that he was the least 
    favorite," where all others played it differently; he was chosen immediately for 
    his unique portrayal. The characters of Tobias and George Sr. were originally going to
     have minor roles, but David Cross' and Jeffrey Tambor's portrayals mixed well with the 
     rest of the characters, and they were given more significant parts. Howard provided 
     the narration for the initial pilot but meshed so well with the tone of the program 
     that the decision was made to stick with his voice. Howard also aided in the casting 
     of "Lucille 2"; the producers told him that their dream actress for the role would 
     be Liza Minnelli but assumed nobody of her stature would take the part. However, 
     she agreed when Ron Howard asked her himself, because they were old friends; she had 
     been his babysitter when he was a child and she was a teen.</p>
     
<br><br>

<p><h3>Production Design<hr/></h3></p>

<p>Arrested Development uses several elements that are rare for American live-action 
sitcoms. Technically, Arrested Development was shot on location and on videotape with 
multiple cameras, parodying tactics often employed in documentary film and reality 
television, straying from the "fixed-set, studio audience, laugh track style long dominant 
in comedy production." The show also makes heavy use of cutaway gags, supplementing 
the narrative with visual punchlines like security camera footage, Bluth family photos, 
website screenshots, archive films, and flashbacks. An omniscient third-person narrator 
(producer Ron Howard) ties together the multiple plot threads running through each episode, 
while humorously undercutting and commenting on the characters. Further, Arrested 
Development also developed a unique self-referentiality through use of in jokes that 
evolved over multiple episodes, which rewarded longtime viewership (and in turn may have 
discouraged new viewers and contributed to the show's ratings issues).</p>

<p><h3>Lawsuit<hr/></h3></p>

<p>In November 2003, the producers of the show were sued by the hip hop group Arrested 
Development over the alleged use of their name. Rapper "Speech" from the group said 
"The use of our name by Fox is not only confusing to the public, but also has the 
potential to significantly dilute what the 'Arrested Development' name means to our fans." 
The lawsuit was quietly settled for an undisclosed sum.</p>

<p>The incident was referenced in the episode "Motherboy XXX." The narration refers to a 
band called "Motherboy," which the narration claims the show is "legally required to 
make a distinction" from, with respect to the "Motherboy" event happening in the episode.</p>

<br><br>

<p><h3>Cancellation and Revival<hr/></h3></p>

<p>During the series' third season in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested 
Development having been picked up by the cable television network Showtime, creator Hurwitz 
declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, "I had taken it as far 
as I felt I could as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to 
a point where I think a lot of the actors were ready to move on." He said that he was "more 
worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" than he 
was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, "If there's a 
way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it."</p>

<p>On October 2, 2011, the entire cast of Arrested Development reunited for a panel at 
The New Yorker Festival in New York. At the panel, Hurwitz nonetheless declared his intention 
of producing a truncated fourth season as a lead-in to a film adaptation. Six years after 
the series had been canceled by Fox, filming for a revived fourth season began on August 7, 2012. 
Fourteen episodes of the show's revival season are set to release simultaneously on Netflix in May 2013.</p>

<br><br>

<p><h3>Future film adaptation<hr/></h3><p>
Rumors of a possible full-length Arrested Development film circulated after the possibility 
was referenced in the show's final episode, "Development Arrested." Arrested Development: 
The Movie is currently awaiting the completion of the revived television series, with the 
script to be written by Hurwitz. In 2008, Howard was slated to direct the film, though it 
is not clear if he still is. Reportedly, all original members of the main cast are expected 
to reprise their original roles.</p>

<!--  
<p><h3>Main Characters</h3></p>

<p><h3>Michael Bluth</h3></p>

<p>Michael Bluth (played by Jason Bateman) is the second oldest Bluth son and the main 
protagonist of Arrested Development. He is the father of George Michael Bluth. In season 
3, it is revealed that there is a typo on his birth certificate, which reads Nichael Bluth. 
Michael's wife Tracey died of ovarian cancer two years prior to the first season. Possibly 
as a result of this, he is very close to his son, George Michael, which is shown partly 
because, whenever an opportunity to spend more time with his son presents itself to him, 
he will jump at it (although this time is almost always immediately interrupted). Michael 
is often reluctant to date, thinking that his son would disapprove, and most of his 
relationships have featured misunderstandings or outright deception. His wife's death is 
usually the subject of tasteless and unaware jokes made by his family members. His role in 
the story is that he is the one son who has no choice but to keep the family together, and 
he serves as the straight man in the comedy series.</p>

<p><h3>Lindsay Bluth Funke</h3><p>

<p>Lindsay Bluth Fünke (born 1965) is the adopted daughter of George Sr. and Lucille Bluth 
who adopted her to "stick it" to Stan Sitwell and then raised her and Michael to believe 
they are twins. She is married to Tobias Fünke and they are the parents of Mae, better 
known as "Maeby".</p>

<p>Lindsay never finished college, opting to "work" full-time for the Bluth Company instead 
when her father offers her a job. She believes herself to be a dedicated activist, but 
she's actually greedy, materialistic and superficial (much like the rest of her family), 
mainly supporting current trendy causes for the social status and regularly holding 
extravagant charity drives–which it is implied raise most of their money from the Bluth 
Company itself. These causes have included but are not limited to opposing circumcision, 
anti-war protests, the removal of the 10 Commandments from a courthouse, the right to die 
(specifically her brother Buster's), and "Graft Vs. Host" (which her husband was afflicted 
with). Despite her outward confidence, Lindsay has rather low self-esteem, a result of her 
mother's constant verbal abuse and her husband's lack of sexual interest in her. She is 
portrayed as extremely resentful towards her husband Tobias, to the point of allowing him 
to fall asleep even though he 'might die' if he does in the episode Afternoon Delight.</p>

<p>After agreeing to an open marriage Lindsay is portrayed as attempting promiscuity 
flirting with and pursuing relationships with men–usually with little or no success. 
During the series she becomes interested in and dates characters such as Moses Taylor 
(star of TV's Wrench) and Tom Jane (star of Homeless Dad and Junk). In season 3, Lindsay 
becomes interested in the family's new lawyer Bob Loblaw, taking a position as nanny to 
his daughter Hope in an attempt to gain his interest.</p>

<p>In the last episode of season 3, it is revealed that Lindsay is not actually Michael's 
twin sister, or even a Bluth at all. She also discovers that she is 40 years old, three 
years older than she had previously believed herself to be. Feeling that her youthful 
allure has now escaped her, she becomes desperate to marry a successful man, and divulges 
to Michael that they are not biological siblings and reveals her wish to divorce Tobias 
and marry Michael. Michael rejects her offer of marriage—he "is not that into older women."</p>

<p>Creator Mitchell Hurwitz came up with Lindsay as the family's liberal figure, but 
Lindsay is also meant to represent a liberal who benefited from her politics more than 
she sacrificed, due to the image she built. The final episode of the series reveals that 
had Lindsay been the daughter of Stan Sitwell, she would have been named Nellie.</p>

<p>Lindsay was portrayed by actress Portia de Rossi. Having previously appeared in 
Ally McBeal, she said that she was looking for a new series like it. De Rossi was also 
attracted to Arrested Development for what she thought was a "fresh new perspective on 
comedy." She played Lindsay as someone who "doesn't have much of a clue but... has a 
pretty good heart." She explained her approach by saying that, "with Ally McBeal, we were 
very rehearsed and staged. But this is a lot looser." Hurwitz felt that de Rossi made the 
character somewhat similar to Lucille.</p>

<p><h3>Job</h3></p>

<p>George Oscar Bluth, Jr. (known by his initials "GOB", pronounced like the Biblical 
figure Job), is the oldest Bluth son and the father of Steve Holt.</p>

<p>By trade a part-time magician, he is a founding member of the "Magicians' Alliance", 
a group that was formed to preserve magicians' secrets; he was later blacklisted by them 
for unwittingly revealing how one of his illusions was performed. He is known for 
incorporating over-the-top theatrics into his magic shows, including pyrotechnics, dance 
routines, and wind machines. Gob's illusions rarely work and he often shoots lighter 
fluid accidentally from his shirt sleeve or collar. He plays Europe's "The Final Countdown" 
before almost all of his major illusions. In the second season, he became president of the 
Bluth Company; however, he is little more than a figurehead, as he wields no real power 
while his brother Michael is still in charge.</p>

<p>George Sr. paid little attention to Gob as a child and has no respect for him as an adult. 
Lucille openly loathes him. On several occasions, Gob and Michael realized that their 
rivalry has been nurtured by their father and mother's manipulations. Gob is known to be 
the womanizer of the Bluth family. Eventually, Gob discovers that he is the father of the 
teenage jock Steve Holt. Toward the end of season 1, Gob marries a dealer of trained seals, 
played by then real-life wife Amy Poehler, in a series of escalating dares. She later becomes 
infatuated with Tobias Fünke, Gob's brother-in-law, and joins the army in the hopes of 
avoiding her attraction.</p>

<p>When his confidence is shattered or challenged, he will burst into tears and cry with 
self-loathing or take extreme measures to cease the disgust he feels in himself. Examples 
of this include the time when he attempted to hang himself with his belt after being 
questioned about topics he was ignorant in, or when he ingested a 'forget-me-now' pill in 
order to forget that he has a son. When upset or excited, Gob often fails to use articles 
or prepositions in his sentences, saying things like "Look at Banner!" and "Still mad me, 
Michael?" He also has difficulty pronouncing words that begin with the letter "c," such as 
circumvent ("ser-sum-vrent"), capability ("crapability") and consummate ("son-summate").</p>

<p>Despite Gob's "womanizing" abilities, he has no real friends; his closest friends are the 
Hot Cops, a group of strippers that Gob once worked with before almost getting his head blown 
off while on the job, when an actual criminal shoots through the door of the motel he's 
visiting, believing Gob to be a real cop. He uses the Hot Cops in many situations, including 
a fake drug bust and for fake friends at a bachelor party. His best friend is Michael, 
though he denies it. He desperately desires to be liked but his habits of treating people 
poorly and lack of any real self awareness prevent him from ever forming bonds. He wants to 
be looked to for decisions but is completely unwilling to accept any responsibility and most 
of his family regard him as an idiot.</p>

<p>He is also the original creator and inspiration for the Mr. Bananagrabber character. 
Although he retains most of the rights to the character, he gave away the animation rights 
to Michael. It was later made into an animated television series that became an infrequent 
background joke. He also briefly had a ventriloquist act with a stereotyped African-American 
doll named Franklin Delano Bluth. Gob and Franklin produce an album together named, "Franklin 
Comes Alive". He is frequently seen throughout the series getting around on a Segway which 
has a pouch that says "Gob" on it. Gob's often repeated lines are "Come on!" and, "I've 
made a huge mistake" which are also used in various forms by himself and other characters.</p>

<p>Gob is portrayed by Will Arnett. GOB's character has been well received and Will Arnett 
has been nominated for a number of awards for his performance as GOB including the Emmy for 
Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2006 as well as the Screen Actors Guild 
Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series (shared with the entire cast)</p>

<p><h3>George Michael Bluth</p></h3>

<p>George Michael Bluth (born March 3, 1990) is the teenage son of Michael Bluth. He is 
a student, and he works at the family frozen banana stand, where he is "Mister Manager." 
He is straight-laced and obedient.</p>

<p>He is reunited with his cousin Maeby in the first episode, and develops a crush on her 
after she forcibly kisses him (to teach their parents a lesson for not letting them spend 
more time together, although it fails because their parents are entirely oblivious to it). 
His nervousness around Maeby and his wrestling with his emotions becomes one of the recurring 
themes surrounding George Michael. In the second season, he starts dating a girl named Ann, 
a devout Christian whom his father and Maeby dislike. Season 2 ends with George Michael and 
Maeby kissing, to his delight. After the incident, the two try to avoid each other for much 
of the third season. Later in the season, he and Maeby accidentally get married during what 
they believed was a fake wedding for Alzheimer's patients in hospital. George Michael's 
marriage certificate states that his birthday is November 2, 1990.</p>

<p>They also kiss passionately when George Michael, suspecting Maeby may be adopted, tells 
her they might not be related by blood. When his uncle Tobias, oblivious to their secret, 
proves to them both that Maeby was their naturally born daughter it becomes more cause for 
consternation to George Michael for the remainder of the series until the final episode when 
it is revealed his aunt Lindsay was herself adopted, thus eliminating any blood ties between 
the two erstwhile cousins. He ultimately decides to escape to Newport by stealing his uncle 
Gob's boat, feeling he doesn't belong there anymore. Upon learning of Lindsay's origins, he 
reconciles with his father and finally reveals his feelings for Maeby. Both realizing that 
further contact with their dysfunctional family is more trouble than it's worth, they escape 
to Cabo with $500,000 and a house waiting for them, not knowing that George Senior has escaped 
to the same destination with the same plan.</p>

<p>Besides his crush on his cousin, George Michael is also shown to be extremely close to his 
father, Michael, presumably as a result of the death of his mother.</p>

<p>George Michael is portrayed by Michael Cera, and in flashback sequences by Christian Lavery.</p>

<p><h3>Maeby Funke</h3></p>

<p>Mae "Maeby" Fünke (born September 22, 1990) is the teenage daughter of Lindsay and Tobias. 
Maeby's conception is an unanswered question and running joke throughout the series. 
In the first season, Lucille hints that Maeby is a test-tube baby; this is again implied by 
Tobias in "Out on a Limb" in season 2. In the penultimate episode, Tobias confirms that Lindsay 
had Maeby, showing a graphic baby photo album; the final episode reveals that Maeby is biologically 
related to neither Steve Holt nor George Michael because her mother, Lindsay, was adopted by the 
Bluths. Maeby attended a progressive school before her parents moved in with Michael. When she 
enters the public school system, her grades plummet. She loses interest in school and looks for 
new ways to shock her woefully neglectful parents. In one instance, Maeby swindles her peers out 
of charity money by pretending to be a wheelchair-using girl named "Surely" who suffers from a 
rare, debilitating illness called "B.S." Maeby also cons her way into a job as a movie executive 
and maintains the charade (with increasing professional success) for several months. She gets 
fired when George Michael sends invitations to her sixteenth birthday party to all the other 
studio executives in her address book, but her boss wants her back when he realizes what a 
celebrity she's become.</p>

<p>Maeby and George Michael spend most of the series battling mutual feelings of romantic love 
for each other. Because the model home is so cramped, Maeby and George Michael share a bedroom. 
Forced proximity and the American remake of "Les Cousins Dangereux" lead to their first real kiss, 
after which the mortified kids start avoiding each other. Maeby legally marries George Michael 
when a "fake" wedding ceremony to entertain Alzheimer's patients goes wrong. On her marriage 
certificate, her birthday is stated to be September 22, 1990. In the penultimate episode, everyone 
except George Michael forgets Maeby's sixteenth birthday, and he spends most of the episode 
attempting to arrange a celebration for her. Maeby is touched by the kindness George Michael 
has shown her; when George Michael explains how she may not be related to the Bluths at all, 
the two share a passionate kiss (and, it is mentioned, reach Second Base). In the final episode, 
"Development Arrested", the two, upon discovering from Tobias that they supposedly are related, 
have a brief conflict over their relationship – George Michael would like it to return to normal, 
but Maeby would like it to remain romantic. In the end, she pitches her life story, as an idea 
for a new television show, to her boss Ron Howard, who says that her story may be better as a movie.</p>

<p>Maeby's knack for stumbling into consanguineous relationships unwittingly is a running joke 
throughout the series. In the second season, she sings an unintentionally provocative duet with her 
uncle Michael and kisses George Michael in a futile attempt to shock her parents. During her estrangement 
from George Michael, Maeby distracts herself by dating Steve Holt, who turns out to be Gob's son and 
Maeby's first cousin. Maeby ends up slipping Steve one of Gob's "forget-me-nows" to avoid having sex while 
tricking Steve into thinking they had.</p>

<p>Creator Mitchell Hurwitz named the character after his daughters Maisy and Phoebe. Hurwitz acknowledged 
the peculiar result of this blending, saying "It just seemed like crazy extra fun to think of weird names. 
I don't want us to become too self-conscious about it but, yes, we do have some strange names." Incidentally, 
she is often described as George Michael's "Cousin Maeby," a play on words making reference to the fact that 
they may not be related. Maeby was initially imagined as a pseudo-conservative, to be a deliberate foil to 
her activist mother Lindsay, but eventually re-imagined to be a troublemaker in other ways. In making Maeby 
an opposite to George Michael (she is bolder and not at all reverent towards her parents), Hurwitz thought 
this also contributed to the idea of George Michael and Maeby developing a romance.</p>

<p>Maeby is portrayed by Alia Shawkat. Shawkat tried out for the part with Michael Cera, who plays George 
Michael, in Los Angeles, and the creators thought they both did well. The two were the first to join the cast.
 For her role as Maeby, Shawkat won a Young Artist Award in 2005.</p>
 
 <p><h3>Buster Bluth</h3></p>
 
 <p>Byron "Buster" Bluth is the youngest son of George Sr. and Lucille, though it is later revealed that 
 his biological father is actually George Sr.'s identical twin brother, Oscar. (The two share obvious personality 
 traits and a mutual habit for awkwardly giving people shoulder massages.)</p>
 
<p>Buster is a professional student, having completed coursework in cartography, Native American tribal ceremonies, 
18th century agrarian business principles and archaeology. Archival footage indicates his participation in various 
university medical studies, such as sleep deprivation studies. As the baby of the family, he idolizes his brothers, 
Gob and Michael. In the second season premiere, Lucille enlists Buster in the United States Army, although his 
training is unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Buster is immature and socially inept; but, as indicated by the narrator in Season 2, he is more intelligent 
than his siblings Gob and Lindsay. He has frequent panic attacks, hates both closed and open spaces, is terrified of 
sheep, seals and birds and is wrathful towards his Korean-born adopted brother, Annyong. Buster demonstrates various c
hildlike nutritional sensitivities: for instance, he becomes hyper from the sugar in juice and irritable after eating 
cheese; he also takes frequent naps. He has an unhealthy attachment to his domineering mother Lucille; one of the 
running gags throughout the series is his quasi-incestuous, Oedipal complex. For her part, Lucille won't let him go 
in the sun, swim in the ocean, or stand on their balcony in windy weather. George Sr. makes reference to the "claw marks" 
left on Lucille's womb after she gave birth to Buster. He sometimes tries to assert his independence by defying his 
mother's orders, as when he dates her rival, Lucille Austero. He has an alienating habit of greeting people with shoulder 
massages, and commonly addresses his relatives by their relation to him (for example, Gob and Michael are greeted with 
"Hey, brother" and Oscar is greeted with "Hey, uncle-father Oscar." Steve Holt is greeted with "Hey, possible nephew"). 
In Season 2, Buster's left hand is bitten off by a "loose seal" (note the pun on "Lucille"), and in subsequent episodes 
he wears a trans-radial prosthetic on his left arm, first a hook and later a prosthetic hand. Despite his obvious 
personality flaws, Buster does care about the rest of his family more than many of the other Bluths, shown when he, 
unlike the rest of his siblings, does not sell the company stocks at Michael's request and fakes a coma so that he wouldn't 
have to testify against his family.</p>

<p>Buster is portrayed by Tony Hale. Entertainment Weekly selected Buster as the uncle for "The Perfect TV Family".</p>

<p?<h3>Tobias Funke</h3></p>

<p>Tobias Fünke is the husband of Lindsay Bluth, father of Maeby Fünke, and uncle of George Michael Bluth. He was the 
chief resident of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital until he lost his license for giving CPR to a man who was not 
actually having a heart attack. At one point, he was licensed as both an analyst and a therapist, supposedly making him the 
first licensed "analrapist" (/əˈnælrəpɨst/ə-nal-rə-pist). Tobias is very fond of awkwardly rolling or somersaulting into and 
out of certain situations mainly to show his dexterity and balance, though this often backfires. Indeed, Fünke claims to 
command "cat-like reflexes."</p>

<p>At the beginning of the series, Tobias decides that his destiny is to become an actor, and he pursues this career 
throughout the series with very little success. Highlights of his "career" include: being turned down for the role of 'Dr. 
House'; landing the part of "frightened inmate number two" in a prison film, only to get fired for not being able to do the 
shower scene due to his condition (see below); portraying George Sr. in the poorly narrated series, Scandalmakers; and attempting 
to join the Blue Man Group as a standby understudy and, as a consequence, spending part of the second season covered in blue 
make-up. In a move inspired by the film Mrs. Doubtfire, Tobias masquerades as a British housekeeper/nanny named "Mrs. 
Featherbottom" in an attempt to spend time with his wife and daughter after Lindsay kicks him out of the model house. While the 
disguise fools no one, the family humors him since this gets the housework done.</p>

<p>Tobias suffers from "never-nude" syndrome (which, as the narrator states, is "exactly what it sounds like") and wears denim 
cut-off shorts under his underwear (and underneath that, a tube sock) at all times in order to avoid anyone (including himself 
and his wife) seeing his genitalia. The condition is similar to severe gymnophobia, although it is portrayed humorously. In the 
episode "In God We Trust", he attempts to reach out to his nephew George Michael during his tenure in the "Adam" muscle-suit 
for the "Living Classics Pageant" mistakenly assuming they have the same phobia (in reality, George Michael is trying to impress 
his cousin, Maeby). He conquers this for a time in the middle of Season 1, but after a close-up picture of his genitalia is shown 
on the evening news (where it has been mistaken for a photo showing evidence of WMDs in Iraq), he is driven back to the cut-offs.</p>

<p>Although never formally admitted, he has said many things that make people question his sexuality. The hints come in the form 
of subtle innuendos and sexual double-entendres, to which he seems completely oblivious. In season 2, Michael advises him to 
record what he says for a day, after which Tobias acknowledges that he is a "blowhard", further showing his propensity to be 
completely ignorant of the implications of his utterances, (in "Ready, Aim, Marry Me"). Lindsay, who married Tobias to spite her 
parents, is convinced that her husband is gay. His self-help book, The Man Inside Me, is a success, though only in the gay 
community, due to the fact that he replaced all gender related pronouns with only male pronouns, to avoid confusion. He has 
experienced sexual difficulties with his wife. This leads to their joint decision to try an "open" marriage, even though Tobias 
himself acknowledges that this path never works. Tobias doesn't really follow through with the "open relationship", and often 
stalks his wife covered in blue paint, following her around on her attempted dates hiding in areas that are blue in color in 
order to remain unseen. Although he continually takes very expensive acting lessons from Carl Weathers, he mainly gets tips on 
frugality from Mr. Weathers. Lindsay continually pokes fun at Tobias' desperation to become an actor, and they split up and 
reconcile many times over the course of the series.</p>

<p>Tobias is played by David Cross</p>

<p><h3>George Bluth</h3></p>

<p>George Oscar Bluth, Sr., called "Pop-Pop" by his grandchildren, is the head of the Bluth 
family and the husband of Lucille Bluth. George Sr. was the CEO of the Bluth Company, which 
he founded. However, after years of "creative accounting" practices, he became the subject 
of an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and was imprisoned. While 
in prison, George Sr. continues to try to exert control over the company, often using Gob to 
undermine Michael's authority.</p>

<p>George Sr. escapes to Mexico with a briefcase filled with evidence of his dealings with 
Saddam Hussein. In season 2, George Sr. fakes his death in Mexico and returns to America to 
hide in the attic of the Bluth model home. Early in the third season, after being discovered 
among the Blue Man Group in Reno, Nevada, he is placed under house arrest. He told Michael 
that he had been set up to build homes in Iraq by a group of British contractors operating 
out of "Wee Britain", and admits that he may be guilty of "light treason." By the end of 
the series, however, it is revealed that he is under the control of his wife, Lucille. 
He escapes to Cabo with Michael and George Michael following the party.</p>

<p>George Sr. is also the inventor of The Cornballer, a faulty product which has been banned 
in numerous countries. He has a religious awakening twice on the show, once becoming Jewish 
after a period of isolation and selling a video series entitled "Caged Wisdom", and once 
becoming a devout Christian after reading a pamphlet in a garbage bag while hiding in the 
attic. George Sr. was born in Cleveland, Ohio on August 5, 1947.</p>

<p>George Sr. is portrayed by Jeffrey Tambor.</p>

<p><h3>Lucille Bluth</h3></p>

<p>Lucille Bluth is the matriarch of the Bluth family. She is the mother of Gob, Michael, 
Buster, and the adoptive mother of Lindsay and Hel-loh "Annyong" Bluth, as well as wife to 
George Sr. Her grandchildren are George Michael Bluth, Steve Holt (Gob's son) and Maeby 
Fünke and they call her "Gangy" /ˈɡæŋɡi/. She carried on an affair with George, Sr.'s twin b
rother Oscar.</p>

<p>Lucille is accustomed to an opulent and decadent lifestyle, which she funds with 
misappropriated Bluth Company money. She treats herself to repeated spa treatments and face 
lifts, and is known to abuse alcohol and prescription drugs and to mistreat her housekeepers. 
According to the narrator, she has never made eye contact with a waiter. Lucille is extremely 
manipulative, narcissistic, amoral, domineering, and emotionally abusive to her children. 
She furtively wrests control of the Bluth Company board from Michael. She has a tight grip 
on her youngest son Buster, who, as a result of his mother's dominance and sheltering, is 
unstable, socially inept, and prone to panic attacks. She also insinuates that her daughter 
Lindsay is fat and lazy. She has also admitted that she never cared for Gob. In the finale, 
it is revealed that she is the mastermind behind the Bluth Company's illegal actions.</p>

<p>Lucille is last seen making a run from the SEC on board the Queen Mary, after Annyong 
turns in evidence against her.</p>

<p>Lucille is played by Jessica Walter.</p>

<p><h3>Narrator</h3></p>

<p>The narrator, voiced by an uncredited Ron Howard, the executive producer of Arrested 
Development, narrates much of the Bluth family's lives, and often interjects quick comments 
while characters speak. He frequently brings up past footage to illustrate his points, and 
along with the cameramen can be excluded from the events of the story at times, in the 
style of a documentary narrator. The Narrator's personal feelings often inform his narration, 
for example in the episode "Spring Breakout", the narrator repeatedly criticizes the narrator 
of the television show Scandalmakers for having no talent and paying no heed to facts. Likewise, 
Howard's own career is occasionally referenced. In the season 1 episode "Public Relations", 
the publicist Jessie insultingly calls George Michael "Opie" (Howard's character on The Andy 
Griffith Show) to which the Narrator responds "Jessie had gone too far, and had best watch 
her mouth." In the season 3 episode "S.O.B.s", he begs the audience to "please tell your friends 
about this show" after George says that begging is "sometimes… the only way to stay in the game." 
The narrator has implied that he knows Maeby from her time as a studio executive. Howard is 
among the individuals in Maeby's contact list to whom George Michael sends an invitation to 
her birthday. In his only on-screen appearance at the end of the final episode, Howard informs 
Maeby, with a hint of irony, that her life story would be better off being made into a movie 
as opposed to a TV series.</p>
